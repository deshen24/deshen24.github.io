I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Data Sciences and Operations](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/departments/data-sciences-and-operations) at [USC Marshall Business School](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/). Previously, I was a [FODSI](https://fodsi.us/) postdoc fellow at the [Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I was fortunate to be hosted by Professors [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/), [Jasjeet Sekhon](https://statistics.yale.edu/people/jas-sekhon), and [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/). I completed my PhD in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) from [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu).
